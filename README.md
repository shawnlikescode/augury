I want to play RuneScape on my MacBook, and Alt1Toolkit doesn't support me as I wish it did. I'm notoriously bad at finishing personal projects, but I do want to learn a bit of Rust, so why not be overambitious while I do?

# Augury - RuneScape 3 Overlay Toolkit

A cross-platform overlay toolkit for RuneScape 3 built with Tauri, React, and TypeScript. Augury provides an extensible plugin system for creating interactive overlays that enhance gameplay while respecting Jagex's rules.

## Project Overview

Augury creates overlays that can display helpful information like clue scroll solutions, XP trackers, and event timers. It's designed (ü§ûüèæ) to be:

- Cross-platform (Windows and macOS)
- Lightweight and performant
- Secure and compliant with game rules
- Extensible through a plugin system
